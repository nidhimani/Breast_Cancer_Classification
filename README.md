# Feature selection and Feature Extraction techniques
For feature selection plotted heatmap to visualize correlations among different features and also drawn feature importances using Random Forest Classifier.
For feature extraction used Principal component analysis.
Through feature selection we reduced number of features from 31 to 19 but through PCA accuracy didn't increase.
# Results
With XGBoost algorithm got highest accuracy : 0.98
# Evaluation metrics
Used accuracy and classification report
